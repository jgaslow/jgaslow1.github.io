		<p style="color:white;"> A must try sushi place is <a href="https://sugarfishsushi.com/"> <b>SUGARFISH</b> </a>. I find the sushi here to be of the highest quality and every bite of fish is extremely fresh. Additionally, the prices are reasonable and you are able to order a lot of food for a good price. The atmosphere is modern but it is typically very busy. I recommend arriving much earlier than you plan on eating due to the long wait time. I reccomend trying the "Try Me." It consists of edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore + salmon sushi, and more. The presentation is fantastic and it tastes just as good as it looks!

		<p style="color:white"> Another Favorite sushi place of mine is <a href="https://www.sushiofgari.com/"> <b>Sushi of Gari</b> </a>. Sushi of Gari has three locations in NYC: Upper East Side, Upper West Side, and TriBecca. The sushi comes fresh and beautifully presented. They serve a wide range of sushi from classic rolls to more specialty rolls. Itâ€™s a small restaurant so I recommend making a reservation in advance. The sushi is on the pricier side but is definitely worth it for the quality. I suggest trying the spicy scallop roll and the salmon piece with roasted tomato.

		<p style="color:rebeccapurple"> One of my other go-to's is <a href="https://www.ren82.com/"> <b>Sushi Ren</b> </a>. Sushi Ren never disappoints. Growing up on the upper east side, this was always my go-to for delivery. It is consistent, fairly priced, and always arrives quickly. The menu is extremely extensive and is easy for picky eaters or those with dietary restrictions to find something that works for them. They have indoor and outdoor seating and are extremely Covid safe. The service is fantastic and the employees are extremely kind and caring.
