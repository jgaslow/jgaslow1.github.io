		<p style="color:white;">The first place on my list is <a href="https://12chairscafe.com/"> <b>12 Chairs Cafe</b> </a>!This is one of my go-to spots, located in downtown NYC. I recommend the warm pita which is freshly made daily and trying all the different dipping spreads. 12 Chairs Cafe is a great place to go for a casual dinner with excellent drinks and even better food. The atmosphere is vibrant and fun and the indoor and outdoor seating gives off a nice ambience. It most definitely will not dissapoint!

		<p style="color:white;"> My next favorite is <a href="https://www.lolataverna.com/"> <b>Lola Taverna</b> </a>. Lola Taverna is a modern style restaurant with beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is covered in flowers and makes you almost feel like youâ€™re outside of NYC. It is perfect for a date night and located in SoHo. The pricing of the food is reasonable but the drinks are a little overpriced. However, they are delicious! I reccomend the trying the lamb chops and Greek salad!

		<p style="color:rebeccapurple;"> Another amazing spot is <a href="https://www.shukanewyork.com/"> <b>Shuka</b> </a>. Shuka is a vibrant and modern restaurant that is great for a date night or bigger group party! The first time I went I wandered in spontaneously and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious my meal was. I recommend making a reservation before hand because we had to sit at the bar and it was pretty crowded. I recommend dipping their fresh pita into their whipped feta dip - it is truly amazing!  Shuka also has great options for vegetarians and vegans!
